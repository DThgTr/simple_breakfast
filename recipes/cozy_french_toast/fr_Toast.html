    <!--Ingredients-->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 small slice of butter (just about any brand is fine)</li>
        <li>1 coffee spoons of salt</li>
        <li>2 coffee spoons of sugar</li>

    </ul>

    <!--Recipe-->
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Put the eggs in a bow together with spoons of sugars, salt and milk, then give it a good twirl with a mixing tool of your choice.
            <br>
            Don't stop till everything is blended together all nice and creamy!
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Submerge the bread slices completely in the egg mixtures. You can either dip the whole slices or cut them up into smaller pieces depending on the mixing bowl size.
            <br>
            Don't leave them in for too long or they are gonna be all soggy!
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Put on the pan and stove, now we do the cooking!
            <br>
            Keep the heat at medium and let the butter slice melt in the pan. Remember to move it around to spread it evenly.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Turn the heat down about a quarter and put the dipped bread slices on the pan. 
            Flip them after about 2-3 minutes.
            <br>
            Keep your eyes on them! Charcoal does not exactly make a healthy breakfast.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Serve on a disk, often with milk for maximum healthiness!
        </li>
    </ol>
