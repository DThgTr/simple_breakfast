    <!--Recipe-->
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Put on the pan and stove and remember to use a pan big enough for 2 slices of bread.
            <br>
            Keep the heat at medium and let the butter slice melt in the pan. Remember to move it around to spread it evenly.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Put the slices of bread on the pan after the butter has melt completely.
            <br>
            Keep the heat at low or we are gonna eat charcoal for breakfast!
        </li>

        <br>   

        <li>
            Put the eggs in a bow together with spoons of sugars, salt and milk, then give it a good twirl with a mixing tool of your choice.
            <br>
            Don't stop till everything is blended together all nice and creamy!
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Wait until the bread is somewhat crunchy (it should be after you finish for egg mixture), then put them aside.
            <br>
            Pour the mixture in and remember to put the uncooked side of the bread face down into the mixture.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Turn the heat up to medium and wait for the eggs mixture to cook. 
            <br>
            And yes! Charcoal warning - keep your eyes on them.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Flip the egg and break pancake around on a disk and fold the excessive size into the breads.
            Put the cheese and SPAM slices on the bread and fold it.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            On the stove once more! Leave the heat at low until the bread slice turn a gold and brownish color.
            <br>
            Flip the do the same for the other side.
        </li>

        <br>

        <li>
            Served hot, best with a nice steamy cup of coffee!
        </li>
